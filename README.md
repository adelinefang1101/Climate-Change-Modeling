*Integrated Assessment Modeling for Climate Policy*


Developed a modular integrated assessment model (IAM) to evaluate climate mitigation pathways and economic impacts

Constructed a full-scale Excel-based IAM coupling economic growth, energy systems, climate dynamics, and damage valuation. Implemented core components including carbon cycle modeling (5-box model), Solow growth framework with Cobb-Douglas production, and Kaya identity emission decomposition.

Designed policy scenarios to analyze abatement costs, temperature trajectories, and consumption impacts under varying mitigation timelines and regional constraints. Quantified transition risks through social cost of carbon (SCC) calculations using marginal damage projections and discounted utility weighting.

Applied model to assess cost-benefit tradeoffs of climate policies, providing quantitative framework for investment decisions and climate strategy development. Implemented advanced features including income elasticity of damages and equity-weighted regional SCC valuations.
